# Trick Wars
A trick-taking tableau-building area-control game
2 players only

## Rules
The game is played over 3 rounds, and after each round players are awarded victory points.
At the end of the 3th round, the player with the most points win.

### Setup
At the beginning of the game, place the board between both players.
Give each player 16 meeples in a single colour.
Place markers to indicate victory points near the playing field.
Give each player 3 action markers to place in front of themselves.

### Beginning a round
At the beginning of each round shuffle the remaining deck and discard pile together to form a new draw deck.
Do not shuffle cards from player tableaus into the deck.
Then deal each player 8 cards from the deck to form their hand.
Then the round can start.
The player with the most military begins the round as the lead player.
In case of a tie, the player with the most movement begins as the lead player.
If there is still a tie, choose randomly.
Lastly flip the top card of the deck to determine the trump suit of the round.
This card is called the current trump card.

Each round consists of 7 tricks.
The winner of a trick becomes the new lead player.

### Playing a trick
The lead player plays a card from his hand.
Then the other player plays a card from his hand with the following limitation:
If possible, a player must follow suit.

Then determine the winner of the trick.
If both cards are of the same suit, the higher card wins.
If one card is of the trump suit and the other is not, the trump suit wins.
Otherwise the leading player wins, as the opponent could not trump and could not match.

#### Winning a trick
The player winning the trick must select one of the cards involved in the trick to add to his tableau.
The other card is discarded.
The player then adds the chosen card to his tableau under one of his action markers.
When adding a card under an action marker, the entire column of cards under that marker will activate in order.

#### Failing to activate
If, for any reason, the activation of a card cannot be performed, that card and all remaining cards are discarded.
For each card follow the rules for activation failure for the given Action Type.

#### Activating Deploy
When activating a deploy card, the player place up to two meeples unto a territory matching the suit of the activated card.
However, the following restrictions are in place:

* If a player can place in an area he already controls, he must do so.
* If a player cannot place in an area he already controls, he must attempt to place in an area adjacent to one he controls
* If a player can avoid placing in an area the opponent controls, he must do so.

The only way to fail deployment is if the player has run out of meeples.
In that case, in addition to discarding each failed card, the player must, for each card, remove one of their meeples from a territory matching the discarded suit if possible.

#### Activating Movement
When activating a movement card, the player may move any amount of meeples *from* a territory matching the activated suit.
when moving meeples, they may move to any neighbouring territory, no matter the colour.
Meeples must be moved as a single group and cannot be distributed across neighbouring territories.

The only way to fail movement, is if the player has no meeples on a matching territory.
There is no additional punishment for failing to move.

#### Activating Fight
When activating a fight card, the player selects any territory matching the suit where he has one or more meeples.
A fight will occur in that territory.
The instigating player may remove one of their opponents meeples from the territory.

The only way to fail at fighting, is if the player has no meeples on a matching territory.
There is no additional punishment for failing to fight.

### Ending a round
When both players hold just 1 card, those cards are discarded and the round ends.
Then both players score points.

### Scoring points
Each territory controlled by a player is worth as many points as the number of territories of the same type controlled by the same player.
E.G. Controlling 2 teal territories is worth 4 points, whereas 3 teal territories would be 9.
The only exception to this is the central suit-free territory, which is always worth 4 points.

In order to control a territory, a player must have more meeples there than the opponent has.
